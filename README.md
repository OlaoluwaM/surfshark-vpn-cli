# Surshark VPN CLI

README update coming soon ðŸ‘€
Currently working on an installation script

However, connection script is fully operational, but until you follow [this guide](https://surfshark.com/blog/how-to-set-up-a-vpn-on-linux) it will not work. You only need to follow the first part of the guide for now

The installation script will handle that part in the future though ðŸ‘€.

## Roadmap

- Make setup script executable by default once it is completed
